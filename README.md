# Functional Fictional University WordPress Theme
*This is more than a wordPress theme. It is an application built off wordPress for a functional fictional university :grin:*

> Ps: The link to the demo is http://thefunctionaluniversity.cf but please read what you can do with the application below before going to check out the demo link.

### In this application, you can do the following;

*1. Login or register as a student and be able to take notes in class which is saved into the university's database. However, feel free to login with these credentials*

> username: testuser
> password: &So$Le3MyD*fq6^WhmcF8Q1n

*2. View the notes you've written anytime you login. You won't have to see the almighty wordpress admin dashboard that could get you overwhelmed. (Isn't that lovely! :grinning:)*.

> P:S BUG! BUG!! There was an issue with wordpress 5.1 redirecting private posts to the homepage. This was noticed after I updated my wordpress core to v5.1. This means you might not be able to navigate to the notes link (for now). However, the site works well in earlier version of wordpress. I am looking to clear this issue ASAP. Please bear with me.

Other functionalities of the app include;

*3. View the programs offered by the University, the locations for the programs and professors associated with the program.*

*4. Like or heart a professor to signal to the university that he/she is doing a good job.*
> Spoiler Alert: :point_right: Professor Barksalot is my favorite professor. But He has only two (2) likes so far because this application won't accept more than one like per user! :pensive: :cry:. Maybe you can help!

*5. View the past and upcoming events that are to take place in the university.*

*6. Make custom search (beyond the wordpress official search box) to see professors, events, locations, programs and blog posts related to your search term.. eg words like Arts, Physics, e.t.c*

> Hmmmmm . I'll think of more functionalities the app offers. But while I'm doing that, feel free to check out and try all of these functionalities by creating an account and using the app :thumbsup:
